## C - Dice and Coin

### Problem Statement

Snuke has a fair $N$-sided die that shows the integers from $1$ to $N$ with equal probability and a fair coin. He will play the following game with them:

1. Throw the die. The current score is the result of the die.
1. As long as the score is between $1$ and $K-1$ (inclusive), keep flipping the coin. The score is doubled each time the coin lands heads up, and the score becomes $0$ if the coin lands tails up.
1. The game ends when the score becomes $0$ or becomes $K$ or above. Snuke wins if the score is K or above, and loses if the score is $0$.

You are given $N$ and $K$. Find the probability that Snuke wins the game.

### Constraints

- $1≤N≤10^5$
- $1≤K≤10^5$
- All values in input are integers.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N\ K$

### Output

Print the probability that Snuke wins the game. The output is considered correct when the absolute or relative error is at most $10^{-9}$.

### Sample Input 1

```input1
3 10
```

### Sample Output 1

```output1
0.145833333333
```

- If the die shows $1$, Snuke needs to get four consecutive heads from four coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{3}×(\frac{1}{2})^4=\frac{1}{48}$.
- If the die shows $2$, Snuke needs to get three consecutive heads from three coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{3}×(\frac{1}{2})^3=\frac{1}{24}$.
- If the die shows $3$, Snuke needs to get two consecutive heads from two coin flips to obtain a score of 10 or above. The probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{3}×(\frac{1}{2})^2=\frac{1}{12}$.

Thus, the probability that Snuke wins is $\frac{1}{48}+\frac{1}{24}+\frac{1}{12}=\frac{7}{48}≃0.1458333333$.

### Sample Input 2

```input2
100000 5
```

### Sample Output 2

```output2
0.999973749998
```

## D - Even Relation

### Problem Statement

We have a tree with $N$ vertices numbered $1$ to $N$. The $i$-th edge in the tree connects Vertex ui and Vertex $v_i$, and its length is $w_i$. Your objective is to paint each vertex in the tree white or black (it is fine to paint all vertices the same color) so that the following condition is satisfied:

- For any two vertices painted in the same color, the distance between them is an even number.

Find a coloring of the vertices that satisfies the condition and print it. It can be proved that at least one such coloring exists under the constraints of this problem.

### Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $1≤N≤10^5$
- $1≤u_i<v_i≤N$
- $1≤w_i≤10^9$

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $\begin{matrix}
>  N\\
>  u_1&v_1&w_1\\
>  u_2&v_2&w_2\\
>  \vdots\\
>  u_{N-1}&v_{N-1}&w_{N-1}
> \end{matrix}$

### Output

Print a coloring of the vertices that satisfies the condition, in $N$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain $0$ if Vertex $i$ is painted white and $1$ if it is painted black.

If there are multiple colorings that satisfy the condition, any of them will be accepted.

### Sample Input 1

### Sample Input 2

### 解题思路

如果边权为偶数, 则两端点同色; 如果边权为奇数, 则两端点异色

## E - 1 or 2

### Problem Statement

There are $N$ cards placed face down in a row. On each card, an integer $1$ or $2$ is written.

Let $A_i$ be the integer written on the $i$-th card.

Your objective is to guess $A_1,A_2,...,A_N$ correctly.

You know the following facts:

- For each $i=1,2,...,M$, the value $A_{X_i}+A_{Y_i}+Z_i$ is an even number.

You are a magician and can use the following magic any number of times:

**Magic**: Choose one card and know the integer $A_i$ written on it. The cost of using this magic is $1$.

What is the minimum cost required to determine all of $A_1,A_2,...,A_N$?

It is guaranteed that there is no contradiction in given input.

### Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $2≤N≤10^5$
- $1≤M≤10^5$
- $1≤X_i<Y_i≤N$
- $1≤Z_i≤100$
- The pairs $(X_i,Y_i)$ are distinct.
- There is no contradiction in input. (That is, there exist integers $A_1,A_2,...,A_N$ that satisfy the conditions.)

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $\begin{matrix}
>  N&M\\
>  X_1&Y_1&Z_1\\
>  X_2&Y_2&Z_2\\
>  \vdots\\
>  X_M&Y_M&Z_M
> \end{matrix}$

### Output

Print the minimum total cost required to determine all of $A_1,A_2,...,A_N$.

### Sample Input 1

```input1
3 1
1 2 1
```

### Sample Output 1

```output1
2
```

You can determine all of $A_1,A_2,A_3$ by using the magic for the first and third cards.

### Sample Input 2

```input2
6 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
1 3 3
4 5 4
5 6 5
```

### Sample Output 2

```output2
2
```

### Sample Input 3

```input3
100000 1
1 100000 100
```

### Sample Output 3

```output3

## F - XOR Matching

### Problem Statement

Construct a sequence $a= \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2^{M+1}}\}$ of length $2^{M+1}$ that satisfies the following conditions, if such a sequence exists.

- Each integer between $0$ and $2^M-1$ (inclusive) occurs twice in $a$.
- For any $i$ and $j$ ($i<j$) such that $a_i=a_j$, the formula $a_i\ xor\ a_{i+1}\ xor\ ...\ xor\ a_j=K$ holds.

<details open>
<summary>What is xor (bitwise exclusive or)?</summary>
The xor of integers $c_1,c_2,...,c_n$ is defined as follows:

- When $c_1\ xor\ c_2\ xor\ ...\ xor\ c_n$ is written in base two, the digit in the $2^k$'s place ($k≥0$) is 1 if the number of integers among $c_1,c_2,...c_m$ whose binary representations have $1$ in the $2^k$'s place is odd, and $0$ if that count is even.

For example, $3\ xor\ 5=6$. (If we write it in base two: `011` $xor$ `101` = `110`.)

</details>

### Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $0≤M≤17$
- $0≤K≤10^9$

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $M\ K$

#### Output

If there is no sequence $a$ that satisfies the condition, print `-1`.

If there exists such a sequence $a$, print the elements of one such sequence $a$ with spaces in between.

If there are multiple sequences that satisfies the condition, any of them will be accepted.

### Sample Input 1

```input1
1 0
```

### Sample Output 1

```output1
0 0 1 1
```

For this case, there are multiple sequences that satisfy the condition.

For example, when $a = \{0,0,1,1\}$, there are two pairs $(i, j) (i<j)$ such that $a_i=a_j$: $(1,2)$ and $(3,4)$. Since $a_1\ xor\ a_2=0$ and $a_3\ xor\ a_4=0$, this sequence $a$ satisfies the condition.

### Sample Input 2

```input2
1 1
```

### Sample Output 2

```output2
-1
```

No sequence satisfies the condition.

### Sample Input 3

```input3
5 58
```

### Sample Output 3

```output3
-1
```

No sequence satisfies the condition.

### 解题思路

首先我们注意到

$$
\forall k\in\mathbb{N}^+,\bigoplus_{i=0}^{2^k-1}i=0
$$

用数学归纳法证明即可, 或者考虑 Sierpinski 三角形

其次我们知道异或的逆运算是异或, 所以我们可以这样构造:

- 若 $K\geqslant 2^M$, 则一定无解
- 若 $M=1$, 则 $K=0$ 有解, $K=1$ 无解
- 其余情况我们可以这样构造

  `0 1 ... K-1 K+1 ... 2^M-2 2^M-1 K 2^M-1 2^M-2 ... K+1 K-1 ... 1 0 K`
